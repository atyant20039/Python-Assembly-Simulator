# Assembler & Simulator (Python)

## Overview

The **Assembler & Simulator** is a Python-based tool designed to simplify the process of working with assembly language. It takes assembly code as input, checks for errors, generates corresponding object code, and simulates the execution of the code, providing real-time updates on register values and computer memory states.

## Features

- **Assembly Code Input**: Accepts standard assembly code as input.
- **Error Checking**: Identifies and reports errors in the input assembly code.
- **Object Code Generation**: Converts assembly code into corresponding object code.
- **Execution Simulation**: Simulates the execution of the object code.
- **Real-time Updates**: Displays the current values of registers and the state of computer memory during simulation.
